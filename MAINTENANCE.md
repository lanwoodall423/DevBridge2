# DevBridge2 maintenance

The coordinator is a small named-pipe server/client in `Source/Coordinator/Program.cs`. One server owns `Runtime/state.json`, active leases, and the RimWorld process. CLI invocations connect to that server, so a caller timing out does not cancel a pending restart.

The RimWorld assembly is `Source/Mod/DevBridge2Mod.cs`. It reads the launch identity and
`DEVBRIDGE_QUICKTEST_REQUESTED`, starts the built-in Dev Quicktest from the main menu after a normal
launch, and atomically writes `Runtime/readiness.json` once `GenScene.InPlayScene`, `Current.Game`, and
`Find.CurrentMap` are all available. The coordinator does not pass a command-line quicktest flag or a
save path.

The lease-holder maintenance path is deliberately explicit: `stop <lease-id>` verifies and terminates
the owned process, confirms that no matching installation process remains, and persists
`gameState=STOPPED`, `maintenanceReady=true`, and a dirty session while retaining the lease. The holder
may replace assemblies during that window and then run `ensure-ready <lease-id>`; no background path
launches while the window is held. A readiness timeout is only a wait failure (`READINESS_TIMEOUT`),
not a replacement-launch request, and retains the exact process identity for a later matching readiness
signal.

Build from the mod root:

```text
dotnet publish Source\Coordinator\DevBridge.Coordinator.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o Coordinator
dotnet build Source\Mod\DevBridge2.csproj -c Release -p:RimWorldManagedDir="C:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\RimWorldWin64_Data\Managed"
```

The mod build output is `1.6\Assemblies\DevBridge2.dll`.
